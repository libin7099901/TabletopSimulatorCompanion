## Setting Up the Game
1.  Each player chooses a color and takes 2 player markers and 1 player tile of that color.
2.  The player who has most recently seen a reptile becomes the first player. They receive the first player marker.
3.  Place the game board and the score board in the middle of the table.
4.  Shuffle all the cards to form a draw pile. Leave some space next to the draw pile for the discard pile.
5.  Put the round marker on the first space on the round track.
6.  From the first player and going clockwise, each player gets as many points as their rank in the turn order. Put each player's score marker on the scoring track to record each player's score.
7.  Put magic stones next to the score board to form the supply.

*You are free to use the Eternity standee. Placing it in the center of the game board will add a nice touch to your photos.*

## The Cards
Each card represents a creature.
1.  **Name of the card.** (e.g., Salamander)
2.  **Summoning cost.** (e.g., 1)
3.  **Family of the card.** There are 5 families:
    *   🔥 Fire
    *   💧 Water
    *   🌍 Earth
    *   💨 Wind
    *   🐉 Dragon
4.  **Effect of the card.** There are various effects that give players benefits. (e.g., Salamander: Earn 1 Red Stone and 1 Point)
5.  **Type of the effect.** There are 3 types of effects:
    *   ⚡ **Instant:** Triggers only when the card is being summoned.
    *   ♾️ **Permanent:** Activates always after the card has been summoned.
    *   ⌛ **Active:** Activates once per round during the Resolution Phase.

## Glossary

### Hands
Hands are the cards that a player gets (usually by taming) during the game.
*   Hands must remain secret from opponents.
*   There is no hand limit.

### Magic Stones
Players usually earn magic stones by selling cards that they hunted. They can then use these magic stones to summon a card from their hand.
There are 3 types of magic stones:
*   Red Stone is worth 1.
*   Blue Stone is worth 3.
*   Purple Stone is worth 6.

---

*   **IMPORTANT)** A player cannot have more than 4 magic stones, regardless of their type(s).
    *   If a player exceeds this limit, they must keep 4 magic stones and discard the rest.
    *   This decision must be made before taking any other actions.
*   Players cannot trade their magic stones for the magic stones in the supply unless a card effect allows them to do so.
*   Players do not receive change when they pay more than the required cost.
*   Magic stones that each player has are public information.
*   The quantity of the magic stones is not limited. If you run out of magic stones, use any other item as replacement.

### Area
*   An area is a zone that a player uses to display the card that they have summoned.
*   The number of areas that each player may have is equal to the number of the current round.
    *   E.g.) In 5th round, the number of your areas is equal to 5.
*   **IMPORTANT)** You cannot have more summoned cards than the number of areas you have. Once you have as many summoned cards as there are areas, your areas are considered full.
    *   E.g.) If there are 5 cards in your area in the 5th round, you cannot summon any more cards in this round until you create a free area by discarding a card from your areas.
    *(Examples shown: Salamander, Burning Skull, Medusa, Mud Slime, Genie Exalted)*

### Points
Players get points in various ways by triggering card effects.
When players get points, they advance their score marker as many spaces as points that they have scored. If any player has a score of 60 or more at the end of the round, the game ends.
**NOTE)** Your score can be reduced by card effects. However, it cannot go below zero.

---

## How to Play
The game is played over several rounds (typically 8 to 10). Each round is divided into 3 phases.

**Hunting → Action → Resolution**

*   In the Hunting Phase, players draft two cards.
*   In the Action Phase, players do various actions, including summoning cards.
*   In the Resolution Phase, players use the Active effects of the cards in their areas.
Successive rounds are performed until the end of the game is triggered.

### 1. Hunting Phase
1.  Reveal as many cards as twice the number of players from the draw pile. Sort them by their families and place them in the matching zone around the game board.
    **NOTE)** If the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discarded cards to create a new draw pile.
2.  From the first player and in clockwise order, each player chooses a card and places their player marker on it. Players may not choose a card if there is already a player marker on that card.
3.  Then, from the last player and in counterclockwise order, each player chooses a second card and places their remaining player marker on it. In other words, the last player chooses two cards consecutively. After the first player has placed their player marker on the last card, the Hunting Phase ends.

---

### 2. Action Phase
From the first player and in clockwise order, players take their turns. A player can take as many actions as desired during their turn. There are 4 kinds of action that players may perform (see right):
*   Sell a Card
*   Tame a Card
*   Summon a Card
*   Remove a Card

*   Players may perform the same action several times.
*   Players may perform actions in the order of their choice.
    *   E.g.) You may summon again a card after you summon a card then sell a card.

If a player has no more action to do or if they don't want to do any action, they finish their turn. The next player (in clockwise order) now plays their turn. Once all the players have finished their turns, the Action Phase ends.
**NOTE)** Players can't end a turn while their player marker is on a card; it must be retrieved by selling or taming that card.

#### Sell a Card
To sell a card, retrieve one of the player markers that you placed during the Hunting Phase. Then discard the matching card and receive magic stones depending on the family of the card (regardless of the cost of the card).
The game board shows the magic stones that players can get when they sell a card of a certain family:
*   🔥 (Fire): Three Red Stones (1,1,1)
*   🌍 (Earth): Four Red Stones (1,1,1,1)
*   💧 (Water): One Blue Stone (3) and one Red Stone (1)
*   💨 (Wind): One Blue Stone (3)
*   🐉 (Dragon): One Purple Stone (6)

*   **REMINDER)** You cannot have more than 4 magic stones, regardless of their type(s).

*Example: Marco retrieves his player marker from the 'Troll'. Then he discards the 'Troll' (Earth family) and gets 4 Red Stones (1,1,1,1).*

---

#### Tame a Card
To tame a card, retrieve one of the player markers that you placed during the Hunting Phase. Then take the matching card in your hand.
*   **REMINDER)** There is no hand limit.

*Example: Marco retrieves his player marker from the 'Hydra'. Then he takes the 'Hydra' into his hand.*

#### Summon a Card
*   First, check whether your areas are full or not.
*   If your areas are full (that is, you already have as many summoned cards as the number of areas you have), you cannot summon a card.
*   **IMPORTANT)** The number of areas you have is equal to the number of the current round.
*   Pay as many magic stones as required by the card costs and place the card face-up in front of you.
*   Even if you pay more than the cost, you don't get any change.
*   **NOTE)** The cost of the card can be reduced by card effects, and these effects can stack. However, the cost cannot be reduced below zero.
*   Resolve the Instant effect of the summoned card, if any.

*E.g.) To summon a card with a cost of 4, you can pay magic stones as follows:*
*   Four Red Stones (1,1,1,1) = Worth 4
*   One Red Stone (1) + One Blue Stone (3) = Worth 4
*   Two Blue Stones (3,3) = Worth 6 (You pay 2 more than the cost but don't get any change back.)

---

*Example: Marco is trying to summon the 'Hydra'.*
1.  *It's the 5th round, which means he has 5 areas. He can have up to 5 summoned cards in front of him. There are only 2 summoned cards yet, therefore he may summon the 'Hydra'.*
2.  *He pays four Red Stones (1,1,1,1) for the cost of the 'Hydra' which is 4.*
3.  *He places the 'Hydra' face-up in front of him. The 'Hydra' has an Instant effect (⚡ Choose 2 between 💎 (Purple Stone) / draw a card / 💰 (Blue Stone). Earn them.) and it triggers. He chooses a Purple Stone and a Blue Stone, then he earns them.*

#### Remove a Card
Discarding a summoned card from their own areas is called ‘REMOVE’.
*   The cost required to remove a card is equal to the number of the current round.
*   **IMPORTANT)** Players can only remove their own summoned cards.

*Example: In the 5th round, the cost of removing a card is 5. Marco pays one Purple Stone (worth 6) to remove a card. He paid 1 more than the cost but doesn't get any change back.*

---

### 3. Resolution Phase
From the first player and in clockwise order, players take their turns.
On their turn, players use every available Active effect (⌛) of the cards in their areas once.
If there are multiple Active effects, they may use the effects in the order of their choice. If a player doesn't have any Active effect remaining, or if they already activated every available Active effect once, they finish their turn. When all of the players have finished their turns, the Resolution Phase ends.

*Example: Marco has 5 cards in his hand. There are 2 cards with Active effects in his areas:*
*   **Griffon:** (⌛ Draw a card.)
*   **Odin:** (⌛ If you have less than 6 cards in your hand, earn 2 Points. Otherwise, earn 1 Purple Stone.)

*Depending on which Active effect Marco activates first, different outcomes may occur:*
*   *He can use Odin's Active effect initially to earn 2 Points (with 5 hand cards), and then use the Griffon's effect to draw 1 card.*
*   *OR*
*   *He can choose to use the Griffon's Active effect first to draw 1 card (now has 6 hand cards), and then use Odin's effect to earn 1 Purple Stone.*

## End of the Round
After the Resolution Phase, the round ends.
Check the end of the game condition. If the end game condition has not been met, begin the next round. Move the round marker to the next round space.
The player on the left of the first player becomes the new first player and gets the first player marker.

---

## End of Game and Victory
If the end game condition has been met at the end of the round, the game ends.
There are two kinds of end game condition:
*   Any player has a score of 60 or more at the end of the round.
*   Or, the 10th round ends.

If your score marker exceeds 60 points, flip your player tile to indicate this.

The player with the most points wins.
In case of a tie, the player among them with the most summoned cards wins.
If there is still a tie, they share the victory.

## Effect of Cards
If the effect of a card breaks one of the game rules, the card's effect takes precedence.

**Medusa** (Active Effect ⌛): Discard a card from your hand, then earn 1 Purple Stone.
*   Every effect must be used. E.g.) Unless your hand is empty, you must activate the effect of ‘Medusa' at the Resolution Phase, which forces you to discard a card from your hand.
*   If the triggering effect is not resolved, the triggered effect is not activated. E.g.) If you cannot discard a card, you cannot get 1 Purple Stone.

**Ember** (Instant Effect ⚡): Earn 7 points. A player of your choice discards one of their summoned 💧 cards.
*   The card cannot be summoned if any part of the Instant effect cannot be resolved. E.g.) You must select a player (including yourself) who has at least one summoned Water card. The player of your choice gets to decide which card to discard. If there are no players with summoned Water cards to discard, you cannot summon ‘Ember’.

**Kappa** (Permanent Effect ♾️): Whenever you summon a card using 1 Blue Stone, earn 2 Points.
*   When summoning a card with a Permanent effect that affects summoning, the card itself is not affected by the Permanent effect. E.g.) You cannot get 2 Points even if you summon ‘Kappa' with paying 1 Blue Stone (for its own summoning cost).

**Eternity** (Instant Effect ⚡): Earn 4 Points for each card family in your area.
*   When resolving an Instant effect, the card itself is considered as already being in the area but not in hand. E.g.) You can get 4 Points for the Dragon family (if Eternity is a Dragon card) when you resolve the Instant effect of 'Eternity' because 'Eternity' is considered as already being in your area.

**Imp** (Instant Effect ⚡): Earn 1 Red Stone and 1 Point.
(Active Effect ⌛): Recover.
*   Recover is a keyword that puts a summoned card back in the owner's hand. If any specific target isn't described, the card recovers itself. E.g.) If 'Imp' is summoned, you recover it in your hand at the Resolution Phase.
